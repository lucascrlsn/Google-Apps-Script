<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>All records modified within Lenel either through <i>Alarm Monitoring</i>, the <i>ID Credentialing Center</i>, or any other means 
 must be recorded as the changes are made by the primary user. This logging system is designed to serve as the focal point for the 
 primary user, who is the Security Officer manning a post. All user log updates occur through the user sidebar located within the 
 logbook. All user input blocks within the associate "Print a Badge or Change a Record in  Lenel" must be filled out. The form will 
 not submit if it is not completed. There are also form validation measures in place to ensure accurate, consistant, and measurable 
 data is contributed by the user.</p>

        The delay is to be expected. This system queires all Logbook Entires meeting specific criteria, then produces a virtual object and displays that object. While initial loading can 
        take a few seconds at most, this allows users of this system to search through all records much quickly then many other methods.
